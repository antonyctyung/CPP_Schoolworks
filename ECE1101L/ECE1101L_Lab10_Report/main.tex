\section{A circuit as illustrated below was set up with a \SI{5.00}{\volt} voltage source}
\begin{center}
    \begin{circuitikz}
        \draw 
            (2,2) 
            to[V_=$\SI{5}{\volt}$] (2,0)
            (2,2) --
            (3,2)to[R=$\SI{993}{\ohm}\approx\SI{1}{\kilo\ohm}$] 
            (5,2) --

    \end{circuitikz}
\end{center}

%4a
\subsection{$V_2$ was measured in the original circuit i.e. when $R_M$ was detached}
In the original circuit, $V_2$ was measured to be \SI{2.48}{\volt}.

%4b
\subsection{$V_2$ would be relatively small if $R_M$ is relatively small}
\begin{align}
    \intertext{Let the equivalent resistance of the parallel configuration of \SI{991}{\ohm} resistor and $R_M$ be $R_{eq}$:}
    R_{eq} &= \frac{1}{\frac{1}{991}+\frac{1}{R_M}}
    \intertext{Let the equivalent resistance of the entire circuit be $R_t$:}
    R_t &= \SI{993}{\ohm}+R_{eq}
    \intertext{From voltage divider rule:}
    V_2 &= \frac{R_{eq}}{\SI{993}{\ohm}+R_{eq}} \cdot (\SI{5}{\volt})\\
\end{align}
If $R_M$ is relatively small, $\frac{1}{R_M}$ would be relatively large as it is inversely proportional to $R_M$; $R_{eq}$ would be relatively small as it is inversely proportional to $\frac{1}{R_M}$; $V_2$ would be relatively small as well as it is directly proportional to $R_{eq}$.

%4c
\subsection{A relatively small resistor $R_M$ was connected, and $V_2$ was measured to be relatively small}
A relatively small resistor with resistance of \SI{11.4}{\ohm} was connected as $R_M$, and $V_2$ was subsequently measured to be \SI{0.053}{\volt}, a value much smaller than the original value of $V_2$, \SI{2.48}{\volt}, as explained in part (b).

%4d
\subsection{A relatively large resistor $R_M$ was connected, and $V_2$ was measured to be the same as the original value}
A relatively large resistor with resistance of \SI{0.986}{\mega\ohm} was connected as $R_M$, and $V_2$ was subsequently measured to be \SI{2.48}{\volt}, the same as the original value of $V_2$, \SI{2.48}{\volt}.

%4e
\subsection{An ideal voltmeter should have a large equivalent resistance}
As demonstrated above, when a voltmeter with a small equivalent resistance was connected to the element measured, the measured value is far less than the actual value. Therefore, an ideal voltmeter should have a larger equivalent resistance.

\section{A circuit as illustrated below was set up with a \SI{6.00}{\volt} voltage source}
\begin{center}
    \begin{circuitikz}
        \draw 
            (0,2) 
            to[V_=$V_s\equal\SI{5}{\volt}$] (0,0)
            (0,2) to[short,i>^=$I_M$] 
            (1,2) to[R=$R_M$] (3,2)
            to[R=$\SI{993}{\ohm}\approx\SI{1}{\kilo\ohm}$] 
            (5,2) to[R,l_=$\SI{991}{\ohm}\approx\SI{1}{\kilo\ohm}$] (5,0)--(0,0)
            ;
    \end{circuitikz}
\end{center}

%5a
\subsection{$I_1$ was measured in the original circuit i.e. when $R_M$ was detached}
In the original circuit, $I_1$ was measured to be \SI{2.49}{\milli\ampere}.

%5b
\subsection{$I_M$ would be closer to original value, $I_1$, if $R_M$ is relatively small}
\begin{align}
    \intertext{Let the equivalent resistance of the entire circuit be $R_t$:}
    R_t &= \SI{993}{\ohm}+\SI{991}{\ohm}+R_t
    \intertext{From the Ohm's Law:}
    I_M &= \frac{V_s}{R_t} = \frac{5}{\SI{993}{\ohm}+\SI{991}{\ohm}+R_t}
\end{align}
If $R_M$ is relatively small, the equivalent resistance of the entire circuit would be closer to the original circuit and, as a result, $I_M$ would be closer to the original value.

%5c
\subsection{A relatively small resistor $R_M$ was connected, and $I_M$ was measured to be close to the original value}
A relatively small resistor with resistance of \SI{11.4}{\ohm} was connected as $R_M$, and $I_M$ was subsequently measured to be \SI{2.47}{\milli\ampere}, a value close to the original value of $I_1$, \SI{2.49}{\milli\ampere}, as explained in part (b).

%5d
\subsection{A relatively large resistor $R_M$ was connected, and $I_1$ was measured to be much smaller than the original value}
A relatively large resistor with resistance of \SI{0.986}{\mega\ohm} was connected as $R_M$, and $I_M$ was subsequently measured to be \SI{5}{\micro\ampere}, a value much smaller than the original value of $I_1$, \SI{2.49}{\milli\ampere}.

%5e
\subsection{An ideal voltmeter should have a small equivalent resistance}
As demonstrated above, when a voltmeter with a small equivalent resistance was connected to the element measured, the measured value is closer to the actual value. Therefore, an ideal voltmeter should have a small equivalent resistance.

There is a large setup violation of -13.269 ns between sp3/number_reg[3]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and sp3/time1_reg[4]/R (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#124 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -13.269 ns between sp3/number_reg[3]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and sp3/time1_reg[5]/R (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#125 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -13.269 ns between sp3/number_reg[3]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and sp3/time1_reg[6]/R (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#126 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -13.269 ns between sp3/number_reg[3]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and sp3/time1_reg[7]/R (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on BTNR relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#2 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on SW[0] relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#3 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on AUD_PWM relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>
